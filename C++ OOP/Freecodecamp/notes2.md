Four OOP principles:

Encapsulation: <br />
       * Refers to bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class. <br />
       * Itâ€™s the idea of hiding data within  a class, preventing anything outside that class directly interacting with it. <br />
       * Keeps the programmer in control of access to data. <br />
       * Prevents the programmer from ending up in any strange or unwanted states. <br />

Abstraction: <br />
       * Refers to the idea to only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden. <br />
       * The classes you create should act like your car. Users of your classes should not worry  <br />
       about the inner details of those classes. <br /> 
       * This is very important when working on your program incrementally. <br />
       
Inheritance: <br />
       * Is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes. <br />

Polymorphism: <br />
       * Describes methods that are able to take on many forms. <br />
       * Allows methods to take on many different forms. <br />
       * Be sure that you are calling the correct form of the method. <br />
       * There are two types of polymorphism: <br />
            1) Dynamic polymorphism: <br />
                - Occurs during the runtime of the program. <br />
                - Describes when a method signature is in both subclass and a superclass. <br />
                - The methods share the same name but have different implementation. <br />
                - The implementation of the subclass that the object is an instance of <br />
                    overrides that of the superclass. <br />
             2) Static polymorphism: <br />
                -  Occurs during compile-time rather than during runtime. <br />
                -  Refers to when multiply methods with the same name but different arguments <br />
                   are defined in the same class. <br />
                -  The parameters are different type or taken in different order. <br />
                -  This is known as method overloading. <br />
